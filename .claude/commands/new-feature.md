description: Create a new feature branch following gitflow conventions
---

Create a new feature branch from the `develop` branch.

1. Ensure we're starting from an up-to-date `develop` branch
2. Ask the user for a feature name if not provided in the command
3. Create a new branch named `feature/{feature-name}`
4. Confirm the branch was created successfully

Follow the gitflow workflow documented in CLAUDE.md.
