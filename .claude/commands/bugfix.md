description: Create a new bugfix branch following gitflow conventions
---

Create a new bugfix branch from the `develop` branch.

1. Ensure we're starting from an up-to-date `develop` branch
2. Ask the user for a bugfix name if not provided in the command
3. Create a new branch named `bugfix/{bugfix-name}`
4. Confirm the branch was created successfully

Bugfix branches are used for fixing non-critical bugs found in the develop branch during development.

Follow the gitflow workflow documented in CLAUDE.md.
